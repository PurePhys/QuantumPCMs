Example parity check matrices for the paper "Quantum LDPC Codes for Modular Architectures".

**Example-5A.txt** and **Example-6B-Classical.txt** are parity check matrices of classical codes used in Sections 5 and 6, while **Example-6B-Hx/Hz** are parity check matrices of the balanced product quantum code (given in txt and mtx formats).
